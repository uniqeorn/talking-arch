## File Integrity Verification

Before attempting to use this iso, especially if burning to optical media such as a DVD, it is a good idea to verify the integrity of the downloaded file. This will ensure that you have a complete copy that is not tampered with or corrupt in any way.

### using gpg

1. download Detached signature.
2. import my publick gpg key: `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys EADD4A627F68A260D24BDF5A183E508302329913`
3. verify .iso file: `gpg --verify TalkingArch-*.iso.sig  TalkingArch-*.iso`

## Build Your Own TalkingArch Iso

If you would like to test the latest changes to the build system, or if you would like to build your own TalkingArch iso, you may clone the git repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alex19EP/talkingarch.git
```

You will also need to clone the Archiso git repository, as TalkingArch is just an alternative Archiso build configuration.

```shell
git clone git://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git
```
