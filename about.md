TalkingArch started as Chris Brannon's personal project to help him more easily install Arch Linux with speech. With much help and input from the
community, and with the wonderful work of the Archiso team powering the back end, TalkingArch has grown to become one of the best available live images for rescue and recovery, as well as for installing Arch Linux.
Although it is not an official Arch Linux install image, the aim of the project is to stay as consistent as possible with the official install image and Arch principles, while adding speech and braille support to allow Arch Linux to be installed by blind and visually impaired users.
